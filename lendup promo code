Cash in advance terms can be associated with any sales transaction in which goods or services are not provided immediately onsite, such as in brick and mortar sales, but rather delayed through a shipping process. Two areas where cash in advance terms can be common include online marketplaces and international trade.

In a transaction with cash in advance terms, the seller requires the buyer to make the entire payment upfront in order to initiate the process of shipping the expected goods. This protects the seller from lost money for goods shipped without payment and also alleviates any need for collections recourse.
